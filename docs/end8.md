I'll help you create a directory structure for your MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration project. Based on the document's comprehensive overview of MCP implementation strategies, I'll create a structured directory layout that supports your research and development goals.



I apologize for the error. It seems I need to use an allowed directory. Let me modify the path:

Now, I'll create a comprehensive directory structure that supports the MCP integration approaches discussed in the document:

Now, I'll create subdirectories to support different integration approaches:

I'll explain the directory structure I've created:

🔍 MCP Integration Project Structure
```
mcp-integration-project/
│
├── docs/                  # Documentation and research notes
│
├── src/                   # Source code for different integration approaches
│   ├── desktop/           # Claude Desktop MCP integration
│   ├── computer-use/      # Claude Computer Use integration
│   └── custom-server/     # Custom MCP server implementation
│
├── docker/                # Docker configurations
│   └── servers/           # MCP server Docker container configurations
│
└── tests/                 # Testing frameworks
    ├── integration/       # End-to-end and integration tests
    └── unit/              # Individual component tests
```

🚀 Design Rationale:
This structure supports the key integration strategies outlined in the MCP document:
- Modular approach to different integration types
- Separate directories for source code, documentation, and testing
- Flexible Docker configuration for custom and hosted servers
- Comprehensive testing strategy

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the directory structure or add any specific configurations to support your research goals?
