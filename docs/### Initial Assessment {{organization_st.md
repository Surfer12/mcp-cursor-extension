### Initial Assessment {{organization_strategy}}, {{tools_management}}

You have a list of commands (operations or “tools”) each associated with a specific domain (e.g., memory, GitHub, filesystem). A key challenge is to organize these commands in a way that allows quick reference, whether you’re coding or simply browsing.

### Contextual Insights

* The commands come from different servers (e.g., `memory`, `filesystem`, `github`, etc.).
* Each command seems to have a concise description of its function and a scope (e.g., “Add a comment to an existing issue,” “Create a table in the SQLite database,” etc.).
* Organizing them efficiently can prevent confusion and speed up workflow.

### Component Breakdown

1. **Domain Clustering**: Each command is associated with a “From server: X”. This is a direct clue for grouping (e.g., all GitHub commands, all memory graph commands, etc.).
2. **Functional Grouping**: Within each domain, you can further categorize commands by their function (e.g., for GitHub: “Issues Management,” “Branching and Repositories,” etc.).
3. **Reference Format**: Consider a tree structure or a table that pairs the command name with a short description and usage notes.

### Reasoning and Analysis {{categorization}}

**A. Domain-Based Organization**
- **GitHub**
  - Issues: `create_issue`, `add_issue_comment`, `list_issues`, `update_issue`, etc.
  - Repository: `create_repository`, `fork_repository`, `create_branch`, etc.
  - Pull Requests: `create_pull_request`, etc.
  - Files & Commits: `create_or_update_file`, `push_files`, `list_commits`, etc.

- **Memory**
  - Entities: `create_entities`, `delete_entities`
  - Observations: `add_observations`, `delete_observations`
  - Relations: `create_relations`, `delete_relations`
  - Graph Reading: `read_graph`, `search_nodes`

- **Filesystem**
  - Navigation & Info: `list_directory`, `directory_tree`, `get_file_info`
  - File Operations: `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `move_file`
  - Directory Operations: `create_directory`

- **Docker & Others**
  - Database: `create-table`, `list-tables`, `read-query`, `write-query`, `describe-table`
  - External: `fetch`, `curl`
  - Other Tools: `qrencode`, `imagemagick`, `hello-docker`

**B. Table/Matrix Reference**
Create a simple table that labels the command, domain, description, possible parameters, and typical usage example. This can be printed or viewed as a cheat sheet.

**C. Search or Tagging**
If you have a large set of commands, you might integrate a tagging mechanism (similar to dynamic tags) to easily filter based on domain or usage context.

### Output Generation Guidance {{practical_application}}

Try constructing a dedicated file or wiki page—maybe titled **“Commands Quick Reference”**—with headings for each domain. Under each, place its commands in an itemized list or small table:
1. **Command Name**
2. **Description**
3. **Common Use Cases**
4. **Sample Invocation** (if applicable)

### Examples {{structure_demo}}

Here’s a condensed table example:

| **Command**           | **Domain**     | **Description**                           | **Usage**                                 |
|-----------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **create_issue**      | GitHub         | Creates a new issue in a repository       | `create_issue(repo, title, body)`         |
| **add_observations**  | Memory         | Adds new observations to the KG entities  | `add_observations(entity_ids, data)`      |
| **edit_file**         | Filesystem     | Make line-based edits to a file           | `edit_file(path, edits)`                 |
| **search_files**      | Filesystem     | Recursively search for files/directories  | `search_files(start_path, pattern)`       |

### Notes and Clarifications

* You can combine domain and functional groups. For instance, within GitHub tools, separate by “Issues,” “Pull Requests,” “Repositories,” etc.
* If you frequently access these commands from a code editor, you could create quick-access snippets or plugin-based reference.

**solution_endpoint**: A recommended structure is to create a domain-based reference file, possibly enhanced with subcategories and a short usage table.
