Let me help you retrieve and analyze the contents of the specified GitHub repository.



Let me examine the README.md first to understand the project's purpose and structure.

Let me examine the source code to understand the implementation details.

Let me examine the core implementation:



Let me examine the core engine implementation:

Based on the repository analysis, I'll provide a structured overview of the MCP Cursor Extension project:

üîç System Architecture Analysis

Core Components:
1. Cognitive Interaction Engine
- Primary orchestrator for processing interactions
- Manages knowledge representation and contextual reasoning
- Implements adaptive learning mechanisms

Key Architectural Patterns:
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Event-driven interaction processing
- Hierarchical knowledge management

Implementation Details:
```typescript
namespace MCPCursorExtension {
  export class CognitiveInteractionEngine {
    // Core Subsystems
    private knowledgeGraph: KnowledgeGraphManager;
    private contextualReasoningModule: ContextualReasoningEngine;
    private adaptiveLearningSystem: AdaptiveLearningOrchestrator;

    // Processing Pipeline
    public async processInteraction(interactionContext: InteractionContext)
    // Cognitive Complexity Analysis
    private calculateCognitiveComplexity(insights: ContextualInsights)
    // Resolution Synthesis
    private synthesizeInteractionResolution(insights, learningOutcome)
  }
}
```

Research Implications:
- Advanced contextual processing capabilities
- Dynamic adaptation to user interaction patterns
- Integration of cognitive complexity metrics
- Extensible knowledge representation framework

Would you like me to explore any specific aspect of the implementation in more detail, such as the interaction processing pipeline or the cognitive complexity calculation mechanism?
